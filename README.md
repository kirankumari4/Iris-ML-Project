# Iris-ML-Project
The Iris flower classification problem is a well-known machine learning task that involves predicting the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, with each sample having four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Based on these measurements, each sample is labeled with one of three possible species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica.

DATASET The dataset used in this project is the "Wine Quality" dataset, which contains information about different attributes of wine samples along with quality ratings provided by experts. The dataset includes features such as chemical composition, sensory characteristics, and other relevant factors.
