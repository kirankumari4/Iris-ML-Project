# Iris-ML-Project
The Iris flower classification problem is a well-known machine learning task that involves predicting the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, with each sample having four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Based on these measurements, each sample is labeled with one of three possible species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica.
